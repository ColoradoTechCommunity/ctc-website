    While this space is intended primarily to serve Colorado, we welcome anybody
    from anywhere in the world who has some attachment to the tech community of
    Colorado: Coloradans, former Coloradans, hopeful future Coloradans, and some
    people who heard this was a good place to rest their hat. You also do not have to work in tech to join Colorado Tech Community! This space is also open to anyone tech-adjacent in some capacity: designers, product managers, testers, makers, hobbyists, etc.
